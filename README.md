# Restart-App
This is a restart App, which was built along side following the tutorials provided by: Credo. This involves my own implementation of that app. 
I have added different functionalities and the SwiftUI code is updated from the previous deprecated IOS15 to latest framework. This also involves using custom images and a different implementation. 

This project mainly highlights the following skills learnt: 
1. Advance IOS design
2. Custom SwiftuI gesture
3. Custom Button Behavior
4. Animations
5. Custom App Logo
6. Light and Dark mode implementation
